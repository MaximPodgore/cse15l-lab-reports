**First Step:**  


Please go to this [site](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php). It's a UCSD site for finding your specifc CSE15L account username (you might use it in other classes) and we're going to use this account to access a remote computer on a ucsd server.

Please put **your** information in like below

Then, try to remember or copy down the last 3 letters of that additional accounts username. The password of it should be your tritonlink password. You'll find out if it works in a later step. If you do have to come back to this and reset it, make sure you disable the option that also resets your tritonlink password.

Above and below are the two sections of the page you see once you look up your account

Next, click on [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to go to vscode's site and download it. It's an excellent IDE for most languages

Next, please click the install button and it should automatically give you the right version for your OS

**Second Step:**  

Open VS Code, locate the top bar, click on Terminal, and then select new Terminal. Like so

Put this in the Terminal, but substitute afs with the last 3 letters of your username (remember?)
`ssh cse15lwi23afs@ieng6.ucsd.edu` 

(here it is so you can copy and paste but please substitute those last 3)

When it works, this should pop up, type yes and click enter

Then input your Tritonlink password to be logged into the server
Once you're in you should see this

**Third Step:**  

Now you're going to goof off in in the terminal since it is a useful tool for navigating remote computers and servers  

Click [here](https://opensource.com/article/22/5/essential-linux-commands) for some essential linux commands  

Here's a quick breakdown of some useful ones:  

`pwd` prints youre working directory  

`cd~` changes your directory to the root folder  

`ls` shows the contents of the directory you're in  

`cd <directory` allows you to change directories (go down the rabbit hole)  

`cd ..` allows you to go out of one folder back to one step before  

`touch` makes an empty file  

`mkdir` allows you to make a directory  

`cat` opens a file

`vi` allows you to write in the file. It's kinda hard to use the text editor so here's a cheat sheet if you're a masochist https://vim.rtorr.com/

Here's an example of me doing some serious goofing with a few of these commands (whatever you do, don't use sudo ðŸ”«):
