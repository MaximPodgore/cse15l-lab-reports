**Part 1**

Basically I made a server which takes in strings from the query and prints them on the site. The code for this is below.

Essentially I made a handler that works with the basic server code to *handle* the things people type in the browser. This handler only responds to the path /add-string.
After the query "?"and the following "=" it will concatenate the string that is left to the website print string. It will throw /n in there to make it appear on
the new line. That's basically it. Basically the only thing that gets changed is that website display string that keeps on getting added to.
Here's some screenshots of it in actions.
